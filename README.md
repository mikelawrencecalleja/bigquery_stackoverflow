Welcome to my Stackoverflow insights project.

### Executive summary

This model can identify the most suitable SME for a given topic in Stackoverflow, and then join this data to the overall Stackoverflow query data in order to gain insight on things such as the 'reputation' of the individual SMEs identified for different Stackoverflow query topics. This is alongside being able to analyse insights such as the level of outstanding queries by day, as well as trends of outstanding queries by topic to help identify spikes in unanswered queries.
